THIS PROJECT WAS MADE BY STUDENTS IN L1 J2 (Taratra and Sedera)

*  We gave the game some basic interface (by drawing it using symbols and console.log() ) to make it more enjoyable.
*   We also gave it more life by making adding functions that show random sentences to make it less static
* I made several moduls so the main JS file is shorter and easier to read.
* 
* => The JS file that  launch the main game is "Card_Game_Battle_Element.js"
